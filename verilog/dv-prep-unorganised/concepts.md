# Interview Questions(unorganised)

1. Why we need both types of coverage(code and functional) ?

Getting to 100% code coverage, doesnt necessarily tell the complete story. Example, imagine a simple AND gate, to get to 100% code coverage, we only need two different types of input combinations - 00 and 11, these two will produce all the output combinations. Then the coverage tells all the code was exercised but we dont know whether our design works or not. all we know is input and outputs of our design are able to take on both logic 0 and logic 1. We couldn't certainly tell our design is an AND gate, it could also be an OR gate.  And this is where functional coverage comes in, So the first thing funtional coverage tells is have observed all the possible values on input. and checking the input and its output tells us which gate we are looking at.&#x20;



Also getting 100% functional coverage is not enough either, Imaginer we have two AND gates whos outputs are given to OR gate and output is taken there. Now we might simply attain 100% functional coverage by defining coverpoints for one AND gate and final output but not exercising the other AND gate.This is called coverage hole and This is where Code coverage becomes crucial, Cause it shows there is a part of code which is not exercised at all.&#x20;



And getting 100% on both code and functional coverage doesn't mean our design is bug free. But it gives confidence, that our design in thoroughlt exercised based on the specifications provided.&#x20;





<mark style="color:red;">Design FSM which detects three consecutive 1's with overlapping. use mealy machine.(AMD)</mark>

For combinational circuits, output value completely depends on input values, In sequential circuits output value depends on present input and also previously stored value. Sequentail circuits are FSM. There are two types Mealy and Moore.&#x20;

Mealy : Output depends on present state and current input. Requires Fewer states. Bit harder

Moore : Output depends on current state only independent of current input. Need more state. Easier

There are again two conditions overlapping and non overlapping.

Overlapping : Final bits of sequence can be start of another sequence.&#x20;

Non overlapping : Once sequence detection is completed, next sequence can be started without any overlap.&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">write a uvm driver for a simple bus protocol(AMD)</mark>

```verilog
interface intf(input bit clk, input bit rst);
    logic [6:0] Addr
    logic [31:0] WrData;

clocking MonCB @(posedge clk);
        input Addr;
        input WrData;
    endclocking
endinterface

Assume you already have virtual interface drv_if connected to 
the physical interface above;                                     

Please implement the run_phase of your driver. 


```



You need to drive the Addr,, WrData generated sequence items from sequencer to virtual interface connecting DUT. For that we implemented the below driver logic, seq\_item\_port.get\_next\_item(), seq\_item\_port.try\_next\_item(), seq\_item\_port.item\_done(),&#x20;

```verilog
class my_driver extends uvm_driver #(my_transaction);
  `uvm_component_utils(my_driver)
  
  virtual intf drv_if;
  
  function new(string name, uvm_component parent);
    super.new(name,parent);
  endfunction
  
  //build phase as question already mentioned virtual interface drv_if connected to physical 
  //interface, so using uvm_config_db::get() to fetch the value of the virtual interface and 
  //assign it to configuration object property(drv_if).
  //getting interface handle using uvm_config_db
  function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    if(!uvm_config_db#(virtual intf)::get(this,"","drv_if", drv_if) )
      `uvm_fatal("NOVIF", "virtual interface is not found");
  endfunction
  
  //run phase
  task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    my_transaction tr;
    forever begin
      seq_item_port.get_next_item(tr); //get next transaction from sequencer
      
      //driving logic
      //drive transaction onto interface
      if(drv_if.rst) begin
        drv_if.Addr = '0;
        drv_if.WrData = '0;
      end
      
      drv_if.Addr = tr.Addr;
      drv_if_WrData = tr.WrData;
      
      @(posedge drv_if.clk); //wait for clock cycle to ensure values are driven
      
      seq_item_port.item_done(); //indicate transactio is done
      
    end
  endtask

<mark style="color:red;">Cache Size is 64KB, Block size is 32B and the cache is Two-Way Set Associative. For a 32-bit physical address, find the bit number of Block Offset, Index and Tag.(AMD)</mark>

calculation of tag bits = L - Set index - Block offset

l is lenght of address which is given in question 32 bits.&#x20;

Block offset is calculated with block size which is 2^5, 5 bits

set index is calculated with no of set in total cache, for that cache blocks should be known, which is cache size/block size = 2^11, we have 2 way set associative so, 2^11 / 2, which is 2^10, 10 bits

tag = 32 - 10 - 5 = 17 bits

Computer architecture related questions. (covered all basic stuff from pipeline, cache, virtual memory, OOO)

<mark style="color:red;">Pipeline Hazards :</mark>&#x20;

Imagine you're designing a 5-stage pipeline for a RISC processor. You notice that for certain instruction sequences, the pipeline stalls frequently. Can you explain what might be causing this, and propose a solution?

Frequent stalls in certain instruction sequences might be because of data dependencies between instructions.&#x20;

Consider this sequence:

ADD R1, R2, R3 #R1 = R2+R3

SUB R4, R1, R5 #R4 = R1 -R5

SUB instruction needs R1 value, but in 5 stage pipeline, result is not available in time.

this is a RAW hazard, pipeline needs to stall because second instruction can't proceed until first instruction is done. we can solve this by following methods, <mark style="color:green;">Forwarding</mark> - implementing the forwarding path that can route the ADD result directly to the SUB instruction without waiting for the writeback stage.&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">Instruction reordering:</mark>&#x20;

possible rearrange instructions, to introduce independent instruction between dependent ones, allowing pipeling to continue without stalls.

<mark style="color:green;">Pipeline interlocking</mark> detect hazads in decode stage and introduce NOPs or stall pipeline when needed.

<mark style="color:red;">Cache</mark>

working on a system where the main bottleneck is memory access time. You've been asked to design a cache system to improve performance. What factors would you consider, and how would you approach this design?

Main bottleneck is memory access time, meaning cpu is frequently waiting for data from main memory.&#x20;

cache features -> larger caches store more data but increase access time and power.

cache line size larger line exploit spacial locality but may waste bandwidth if only small portions are used.

cache associativity tells how data is mapped and accessed within the cache

Replacement policy tells which cache line to evict when a new line is brought in. ( there are different methods for this lru, mru, .. )

OOO is a technique in modern processor utilize instruction level parallelism, ooo allows the instruction to differently from the program order,&#x20;

How it works: a) Instructions are fetched and decoded. b) They're placed in reservation stations, waiting for their operands to be ready. c) As soon as an instruction's operands are available, it can be executed, regardless of program order. d) Results are placed in the reorder buffer. e) Instructions are retired (committed) in program order to maintain correct program state.

Implement checks in scoreboard



```verilog
class my_scoreboard extends uvm_scoreboard;
    `uvm_utils_component(my_scoreboard)
    
    function new(string name="", uvm_component parent);

    endfunction
//port to recieve packets from monitor
uvm_analysis_imp#(my_transaction, my_scoreboard) item_collected_export;

//array to store expected results
bit [31:0] expected_results[bit[31:0] ];

//instantiate analysis port
function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    super.build_phase(phase);
    item_collected_export = new("item_collected_export", this);
endfunction
//storing data or action to be taken when data is received from analysis port
virtual function void write(my_transaction trans);
    bit[31:0] expected_data;
    //check if we have expected results for this addr
    if(expected_results.exists(trans.addr)) begin
        expected_data = expected_results[trans.addr];
        
        //compare expected results and actual data
        if(trans.data == expected_data) begin
            `uvm_info(get_type_name(), $sformatf("PASS: Addr=%0h, Expected=%0h, Actual=%0h", 
                  trans.addr, expected_data, trans.data), UVM_LOW)
              end else 
              `uvm_error(get_type_name(), $sformatf("Unexpected transaction: Addr=%0h, Data=%0h", 
                 trans.addr, trans.data))
         end
 endfunction

<mark style="color:red;">Can you explain OOP concepts in SystemVerilog</mark>

Inheritance: is the ability to create child class(derived class) from parent class(base class) to reuse properties and methods of base class.

Polymorphism:Ability to process objects differently based on their data members.

abstraction: is the ability to hide the information from different classes.

encapsulation: including or joining the data member and methods into a single unit like class.\

<mark style="color:red;">Implement (A+B+C+D). (A+B+C+E). (A+B+C+F) using one 4-input OR gate and one 3-input AND gate.</mark>

As A+B+C is common across three expressions, we can write the whole expression like this

(A+B+C) + D . (A+B+C) + E . (A+B+C) + F = (A+B+C) + (D.E.F)

here D.E.F can be implemented using 3 input AND gate and lets assume X is output of this 3 input AND gate and we OR that with the above expression (A+B+C+X), which we need a 4 input OR gate to implement, solving the expression using 3 input AND and 4 input OR gate



<mark style="color:red;">This was more like a discussion rather than an interview. Interviewer shared his screen with a design that had 3 masters, an arbiter, and an ALU. (ALU was on different clock domain, so there was a FIFO in between) Interviewer asked about the testbench architecture and many implementation specifics for the TB.</mark>

So, UVM components needed for these are, 3 Master are there, so we need three agents for each of the master's, we need a monitor for arbiter, ALU, FIFO monitor, scoreboard, Virtual sequencer, ENV

<mark style="color:red;">Can you explain setup and hold time violations, their impact on a design, and how you would address them?</mark>

Setup time and hold time violations are crucial timing violations in digital design that lead to metastability and functional errors



Setup time violation: Occurs when data doesn't arrive early enough and stabilize at input of flop before the clock edge arrives. This causes flip flop to capture incorrect data or enter metastability state.

This can be fixed by reducing the clock frequency, thus making the data arrive faster, Optimize critical paths(gate sizing,..),&#x20;

Hold time violation: Occurs when the data changes too quickly after the clock edge, and before ff had any time to properly latch or capture the value. This causes ff to capture new data instead of intended data leading to race conditions.

This can be fixed by introducing buffer or delay elements into the pipelines or short paths, Optimize clock tree to reduce clock skew, &#x20;



<mark style="color:red;">"Explain the concepts of ideal path and false path constraints in synthesis. How and when would you use them?"</mark>

Synthesis constraints are crucial for guiding the synthesis tool to optimize the design correctly.&#x20;

Ideal path: path assumed to have zero delays during timing analysis.&#x20;

False path: A false path is a logical path in a digital circuit that exists in the netlist or RTL description but is not relevant for timing analysis because it will never be functionally active or doesn't need to meet timing constraints. Essentially, it's a path that the signals will never actually traverse during normal operation of the circuit.

Key points about false paths:

1. They are usually specified to the synthesis and static timing analysis (STA) tools.
2. Identifying false paths can help relax timing constraints and improve overall design performance.
3. They're often found in complex control logic or multi-clock domain designs.





<mark style="color:red;">Describe open page and closed page policies in DRAM memory systems. What are their trade-offs.</mark>

Open page and closed page are memory management strategies in DRAM systems.&#x20;

Open page : keeps the Most recently accessed row(page) in sense amplifier, anticipating future access to same row.

Closed page : closes the page access after each access.



<mark style="color:red;">Synchronous vs Asynchronous reset: Which is better?</mark>

Synchronous Reset: In a synchronous reset, the reset signal is sampled on the active edge of the clock. The state elements (like flip-flops) change their state only on the clock edge when the reset is active.

Asynchronous Reset: An asynchronous reset can change the state of flip-flops immediately, regardless of the clock signal. It typically uses the asynchronous input of flip-flops.

Now, let's look at the pros and cons of each:

Synchronous Reset:

Pros:

1. Predictable timing: Since the reset occurs only on clock edges, the behavior is more predictable and easier to analyze in timing simulations.
2. Easier to implement in FPGAs: Many FPGA architectures are optimized for synchronous resets, making them easier to implement and potentially faster.
3. Reduced metastability risk: Because the reset is synchronous with the clock, there's less chance of metastability issues when the reset is released.

Cons:

1. Longer reset time: The system must wait for the next clock edge to reset, which can be an issue in time-critical applications.
2. More complex reset tree: Ensuring that the reset reaches all flip-flops at the same clock edge can be challenging in large designs, potentially leading to clock skew issues.
3. Higher power consumption: The clock tree must be active for the reset to propagate, which can increase power consumption during reset.

Asynchronous Reset:

Pros:

1. Immediate response: The system can be reset instantly, without waiting for a clock edge, which is crucial in some safety-critical systems.
2. Simpler reset distribution: The reset signal doesn't need to be synchronized with the clock, simplifying the reset tree design.
3. Can operate without a clock: Useful in systems where the clock might not be reliable or available immediately after power-up.

Cons:

1. Potential for metastability: If the reset is released close to a clock edge, it can cause metastability issues, leading to unpredictable behavior.
2. More challenging timing analysis: The asynchronous nature makes it harder to predict and analyze timing in complex systems.
3. Recovery time issues: Flip-flops have specific timing requirements (recovery time) after an asynchronous reset, which can be challenging to meet in high-speed designs.

In practice, the choice between synchronous and asynchronous reset often depends on the specific requirements of the system. For example:

* In a safety-critical system that needs to respond to faults immediately, an asynchronous reset might be preferred.
* In a high-speed, complex FPGA design, a synchronous reset might be more suitable for its predictability and ease of implementation.

Some designers even use a combination of both: an asynchronous reset for initial power-up, followed by synchronous resets for normal operation. This approach aims to combine the immediate response of asynchronous reset with the predictability of synchronous reset.

This can be done in cascaded approach, we can build 3:1 mux using two 2:1 muxes, mux1 has inputs a and b, whose output is one of the inputs to mux2 along with third input c, thus s0 and s1 are select lines for mux 1 and mux 2, thus creating a 3:1 mux.
