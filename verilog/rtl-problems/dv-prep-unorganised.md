# DV Prep(Unorganised)

I Will post the dv questions i have came across, Initially this page is unorganised, will do it later.



1\)  What's the difference between having multiple constraint blocks vs combining all constraints blocks into a single one, how does constraint solver treat it differently and what are the trade off's?

A) Multiple constraint blocks, where each block is solved separately based on the order of the blocks.&#x20;

Single combined block's all constraints are solved simultaneously,&#x20;
