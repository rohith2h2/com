# To prep

Hey there, fellow newbie in the world of semiconductor job hunting! I'm on the lookout for opportunities in the industry, specializing in RTL design and coding problem-solving. Here's the plan: we're going to dive deep into each RTL problem, dedicating a page to explore the concepts behind the solutions. This approach will help us grasp the designs more clearly and uncover various methods to tackle new questions.

I've put together a list of topics that we need to master to ace any digital design interview:

* Clock dividers and counters
* Synchronous and asynchronous designs, clock domain crossing, setup and hold violations, synchronizers
* Encoders and decoders, gray and binary code conversion
* Nailing down concepts like synchronous and asynchronous FIFOs, depth calculation, parameterized gray code equations, and timing aspects

Additionally, I stumbled upon a site featuring a set of RTL questions designed to help us ace those interviews. We'll tackle those problems together as well. Ready to dive into the world of RTL problem-solving? Let's do this!

That sums up my GOALS!!!
