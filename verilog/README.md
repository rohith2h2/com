# ðŸ˜‡ Welcome :)

Overview

There is a roadmap to follow, here we are going to learn about digital design using verilog and we will be moving toward verification using systemverilog. Everyday I will be updating this gitbook with the learning from that day. Date is not specified, But the order we will follow is Digital design -> verilog mastery -> systemverilog -> opensource projects.
