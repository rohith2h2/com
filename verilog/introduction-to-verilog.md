# Introduction to verilog:

Verilog is a type of HDL used in designing FPGAs and ASICs. Compared with traditional software languages, verilog works very differently. We will be learning verilog by implementing digital design concepts in verilog code. In this way, we will be learning faster and efficiently.



## Implementing AND in verilog:

For implementing AND gate in verilog we need three signals, 2 inputs and 1 output. we will use " & " operator for AND operation between input\_1 and input\_2.

For every verilog code we need to create a module where we will be writing all the logic.

```
// AND implementation in verilog
module AND_gate(input_1, input_2, output_AND); //signals are defined
    input input_1;
    input input_2;
    output output_AND;
    wire AND_temp;
    assign AND_temp = input_1 & input_2;
    assign output_AND = AND_temp;
endmodule
```
